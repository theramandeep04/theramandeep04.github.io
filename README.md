* Steps to run the project locally:

   ` Clone the project`

     `git clone https://github.com/theramandeep04/theramandeep04.github.io.git`

### Points to note:

* The main web page is divided into sections with different css file for each.
* I have used JavaScript libraries such as [TagCloud.js](https://github.com/mcc108/TagCloud), [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/), [AOS Library](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) for various animations on my web page.
* Used animated rotating words implementation.
* For contact forms I have used [formsubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co/) 

Feel free to raise issues if you find any bugs in the site.
